				<h3>What is a blog ?</h3><br>
				<p id="firstpara">A blog is an online website displaying
					information in the reverse chronological order, with
					the latest posts appearing first, at the top. It is a 
					platform where a writer or a group of writers
					share their views on an individual subject.</p>
				<p id="secondpara">A lot of people wonder why blogs and
					blogging have become so popular. Blogs provide a
					social outlet. Many people, by nature, are social animals.
					They actively seek out other people offline or online for 
					interaction and sharing of knowledge and perspectives.
					Even many people who are anti-social in face-to-face,
					offline settings enjoy interacting online through social
					networks using their true identities or anonymous personas.
					Since a blog is a social tool, creating or reading blogs
					provides them with a better alternative method for interacting with
					others that did not previously exist.</p>

					<b>What a blog is used for ?</b><br>
			       <ol type="1">
					   <li>To share information about a given topic
						    and become an expert in an industry.</li>
					   <li>To attract visitors to your site, and turn those 
						   visitors into leads.</li>
					   <li> To interact and engage with an audience.</li>
				   </ol>
